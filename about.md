subtitle: Who are we?

We are a group of friends who loved making stuff so much we decided to start a club. Originally, the club was going to be to allow people to gain access to certain tools that would have otherwise been out of reach, such as Vex Robotics and 3D printers. However, as we continued to plan, we decided that we should also foster the spirit of making and create projects for the club to do as a whole, developing crucial skills and collaboration. As of yet, we aren't an official club--we still need to register with AK's ICC--but we have seen a large amount of interest in our club.

Here's our constitition that we totally didn't plagerize from Esther Mun's constitution for the old computer science club. [constitution](/files/Constitution.pdf)
