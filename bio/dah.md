# Daniel Hwang
Hello! I'm Daniel Hwang and I'm a senior. 
Like the name says, I'll be in charge of communications and delivering necessary information to the masses.

I'm interested in various things, but two of my main passions are Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I also enjoy collaborating on tech projects, hence why I joined this club. 
Look forward to seeing you around club meetings.
