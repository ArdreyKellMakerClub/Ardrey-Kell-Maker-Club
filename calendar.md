Welcome to the Calendar! You'll find all of our meeting dates & general gists here. We're going to have weekly meetings dedicated to the club, but we'll also have some supplemental events, as deemed necessary by the club.

So if you're ever unsure when we meet, refer to here. Or the Remind group. If you feel something is missing, please email us at akmakerclub@gmail.com and we'll fix the calendar as soon as we can. Thank you for stopping by.
