# Welcome to Ardrey Kell's Maker Club!

### Things missing from announcement

because the announcement people cut out half of our announcement, including room, i thought it would be fitting to put the unabridged announcement below

> Do you think rockets and drones are cool? Do you want to learn how to make a website or code a video game? Do you like working with others to solve challenging problems? From video games to drones to 3D printers, you join others in making amazing things at the AK Maker Club. Come to the interest meeting on Wednesday, September 20th in Mrs. Robinsonâ€™s room, B303 to see how we made an omni-directional robot, a text based rpg, and maybe even a working chess robot.
